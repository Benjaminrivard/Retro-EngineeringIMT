<h1>Java Pet Store Reference Application, 2.0 Early Access</h1>
<h2><a href="./faces/index.jsp">Enter the Store</a></h2>
The Java Pet Store Reference Application is a sample application
brought to
you by the <a href="http://blueprints.dev.java.net/">Java BluePrints</a>
program at <a href="http://sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>.
This application is designed to illustrate how the Java EE 5 Platform
can be used to develop an AJAX-enabled Web 2.0 application. The
application comes with full source-code available under a&nbsp;
BSD-style license, so you can experiment with it and use it in your own
applications. <br>

Now that you have the application deployed, you can use it and try out
the features. You can browse the catalog of pets for sale, sell your
own pets on the store, search for pets by location using Google maps,
view the RSS news bar for BluePrints news, and more.<a

<p>Here are some of the features of this application. For a detailed
description of&nbsp; the features in the Java Pet
Store Reference application, please&nbsp; refer to the article at <a

<ol>
  <li>Using AJAX for single-page interactive Web applications: The
application is designed to be a single-page application where the user
never leaves the page. Different sections of the page are dynamically
loaded based on the user actions. These sections are loaded
asynchronously to avoid any browser refreshes, and to give a richer
interactive user-experience.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Mash-ups with Google maps: The petstore uses a mashup with
Google's Map service, alongwith Yahoo's Geo-coder service to allow
users to see the available pets in a neighborhood.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Community-created content: The application allows a user to add a
pet for sale or adoption on the Website. The seller uploads&nbsp;</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Using Captchas to discourage spam in the community created
content: Whenever a website allows its users to add content, it needs
to build mechanisms to discourage placement of spurious content on its
Website through automated mechanisms. We demonstrate how captchas can
be used for this purpose.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Community rated content: Each item in the petstore website can
be rated by the users&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Payments through PayPal: The application provides a meeting
ground for
buyers and sellers of pets. The application uses the PayPal service to
allow sellers to accept payments.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Integration of an RSS feed: The website integrates an RSS feed of
news items coming out the Java BluePrints website. The </li>
  <li>Integration of &nbsp;a search engine: The application integrates
Apache Lucene search engine to handle all website searches. </li>
</ol>
This application also demonstrate the use of various features of&nbsp;
the Java EE 5 platform such as: <br>
<ol>
  <li>JavaServer Faces: Many of the AJAX features are implemented as
reusable JavaServer Faces components.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Java Persistence API: The application uses Java Persistence APIs
to create an object/relational mapping layer.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Dependency Injection: The application uses dependency injection
instead of deployment descriptors.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="contributors"></a>Show Appreciation for Pet Store Image
Contributors</h2>
<p>For many images in the Java Petstore, some organizations and people
were kind enough to give us permission to photograph their animals or
even give us photos to use in the Java Petstore. See the <a
 href="https://blueprints.dev.java.net/petstore/imagecontributors.html">
image contributors </a> page for a more detail on these friends of the
animals.&nbsp;
